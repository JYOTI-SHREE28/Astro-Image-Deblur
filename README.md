# 🌌 Astro-Image-Deblur 🌠

Astro-Image-Deblur is a project aimed at enhancing the quality of astronomical images by removing blur caused by atmospheric disturbances, camera motion, or other factors. It leverages deep learning and image processing techniques to restore clarity to blurred astronomical photos, helping astronomers and astrophotographers obtain sharper, more detailed images.

-**🔭 Use Cases**


- **📷 Astrophotography Enhancement**  
  Improve the clarity of night sky images captured with long exposure or low-end equipment.

- **🔬 Astronomical Research**  
  Restore faint or blurry telescope imagery for better analysis of celestial bodies like stars, galaxies, and nebulae.

- **🌌 Space Observation Projects**  
  Reduce blur caused by Earth’s atmosphere or satellite motion in images from observatories and space telescopes.

## ✨ Features

- **Image De-blurring**: Removes blur from astronomical images, improving their clarity. 🌫️➡️🔭
- **Deep Learning Models**: Uses deep learning techniques to predict and restore lost details. 🤖🧠
- **Image Preprocessing**: Includes noise reduction and enhancement to improve image quality before de-blurring. 🖼️✨
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line or graphical user interface to input images and get deblurred results. 💻🎨

## 🚀 Installation

To get started with Astro-Image-Deblur, follow these steps:

### 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+ 🐍

### ▶️ How to Run the Project

To deblur, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JYOTI-SHREE28/Astro-Image-Deblur.git
cd Astro-Image-Deblur

# Add desired images to the dataset directory (e.g., apod_images)
python deblur_image.py
